A trigger is the actuator of behavior—the spark plug in the engine. Triggers come in two types: external and internal.8 Habit-forming products start by alerting users with external triggers like an e-mail, a Web site link, or the app icon on a phone.

3. Variable Reward What distinguishes the Hooked Model from a plain vanilla feedback loop is the Hook’s ability to create a craving. Feedback loops are all around us, but predictable ones don’t create desire. The unsurprising response of your fridge light turning on when you open the door doesn’t drive you to keep opening it again and again. However, add some variability to the mix—suppose a different treat magically appears in your fridge every time you open it—and voilà, intrigue is created.

Although dopamine is often wrongly categorized as making us feel good, introducing variability does create a focused state, which suppresses the areas of the brain associated with judgment and reason while activating the parts associated with wanting and desire.12

4. Investment The last phase of the Hooked Model is where the user does a bit of work. The investment phase increases the odds that the user will make another pass through the cycle in the future. The investment occurs when the user puts something into the product of service such as time, data, effort, social capital, or money.

As Barbra enjoys scrolling through the Pinterest cornucopia, she builds a desire to keep the things that delight her. By collecting items, she gives the site data about her preferences. Soon she will follow, pin, repin, and make other investments, which serve to increase her ties to the site and prime her for future loops through Pinterest’s Hook.

Recently, a blog reader e-mailed me, “If it can’t be used for evil, it’s not a superpower.” He’s right. And under this definition, building habit-forming products is indeed a superpower. If used irresponsibly, bad habits can quickly degenerate into mindless, zombielike addictions for some users.

REMEMBER & SHARE Habits are defined as “behaviors done with little or no conscious thought.” The convergence of access, data, and speed is making the world a more habit-forming place. Businesses that create customer habits gain a significant competitive advantage. The Hooked Model describes an experience designed to connect the user’s problem to a company’s product frequently enough to form a habit. The Hooked Model has four phases: trigger, action, variable reward, and investment.

I also saw how, throughout time and in all countries, the people who have the wealth are the people who own the means of wealth production. In order to maintain or increase their wealth, they work with the people who have the political power, who are in a symbiotic relationship with them, to set and enforce the rules.

this dynamic leads to a very small percentage of the population gaining and controlling exceptionally large percentages of the total wealth and power, then becoming overextended, and then encountering bad times, which hurt those least wealthy and least powerful the hardest, which then leads to conflicts that produce revolutions and/or civil wars. When these conflicts are over, a new world order is created, and the cycle begins again.

Having fled the Holocaust, my parents, both artists, wanted a more worldly, less provincial, religious upbringing for me.1 My spiritual education, as a result, took place in a Unitarian church. We would spend six months studying one religion—going to its services, reading its books, having dialogues with its leaders—and then move on to the next. The theme was "many paths to the truth." I noticed, of course, many parallels among the world's religious traditions, but even the inconsistencies were illuminating.

This, then, was the dramatic tension in each book in the series: what ingenious idea would Tom and his friends come up with to save the day?2 The moral of these tales was simple: the right idea had the power to overcome a seemingly overwhelming challenge.         To this day, I remain convinced of this basic philosophy: no matter what quandaries we face—business problems, health issues, relationship difficulties, as well as the great scientific, social, and cultural challenges of our time—there is an idea that can enable us to prevail. Furthermore, we can find that idea. And when we find it, we need to implement it. My life has been shaped by this imperative. The power of an idea—this is itself an idea.

Month after month, he patiently waits, yet only tiny patches of lily pads can be discerned, and they don't seem to be expanding in any noticeable way. With the lily pads covering less than 1 percent of the lake, the owner figures that it's safe to take a vacation and leaves with his family. When he returns a few weeks later, he's shocked to discover that the entire lake has become covered with the pads, and his fish have perished. By doubling their number every few days, the last seven doublings were sufficient to extend the pads' coverage to the entire lake. (Seven doublings extended their reach 128-fold.) This is the nature of exponential growth.

WIE MAN VON SEINEN FEINDEN PROFITIERT Als König Hieron einst mit einem seiner Feinde sprach, warf der ihm vor, er hätte einen stinkenden Atem. Der gute König war einigermaßen bestürzt darob, und sobald er nach Hause kam, schalt er seine Frau: »Wie ist das möglich, warum hast selbst du mir das nie gesagt?« Die Frau, eine liebe, einfältige und tugendhafte Person, antwortete: »Herr, ich habe an-genommen, der Atem aller Männer müsse so riechen.« Damit ist klar, daß wir über Fehler, die alle Welt riecht, sieht oder sonst wie wahrnimmt, eher von unseren Feinden unterrichtet werden als von unseren Freun-den oder Verwandten.

Menschen in Ruhe zu lassen, die sich vor Ihnen verschließen, ist eine kluge Entscheidung; man kann einfach nicht alle verführen.

Beautiful women are secretly lonely. We think it’s because they are intimidating to others. This may be true, of course, but there is something else here, something a little more fundamental, something beyond the obvious. Beautiful women are lonely because they are never fully included in the lives of others. Men are rarely honest with them about their intentions and women are a little unsure of them, a little suspicious, a little mistrustful, a little wary.

Beautiful women do not care about these things at all. They are attracted to only one thing in men: beauty. And what is the beauty in a man? A lifelong devotion to a personal passion, a passion larger than him, larger than her, larger than the whole wide world, a passion that radiates from his pores until the day he dies. This is the beauty of men. And this is why beautiful women are forever in love with starving artists, musicians, dreamers, iconoclasts. They love these men because they, too, possess a certain, rare beauty. They, too, are set apart.

•    It can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Feelings of self-pity can lead to living a pitiful life. When you feel sorry for yourself, it’s unlikely you’ll perform at your best. As a result, you may experience more problems and increased failures, which will breed more feelings of self-pity. •    It prevents you from dealing with other emotions.

First, it is an outlier, as it lies outside the realm of regular expectations, because nothing in the past can convincingly point to its possibility. Second, it carries an extreme impact. Third, in spite of its outlier status, human nature makes us concoct explanations for its occurrence after the fact, making it explainable and predictable.

The inability to predict outliers implies the inability to predict the course of history, given the share of these events in the dynamics of events. But we act as though we are able to predict historical events, or, even worse, as if we are able to change the course of history.

Anxiety & Fear: This will bring up the “fight or flight” response in humans. Unfortunately for us, like deers, humans are hard-wired to flight. Once fear comes up, we’ve got to get out of that situation. We will do anything to avoid anything that causes anxiety or fear. Which is why you might find yourself escaping when you feel a negative emotion.

Focus on lifestyle changes, not life-changing outcomes. Meaning, develop habits that support the actions needed for you to achieve your goals. This comes back to focusing on the ends, not the means. It sounds contradictory, but in terms of goals, focus on what you want. In terms of habits, focus on what person you need to become to get those goals. It’s far more important to focus on the person you need to become, than it is to focus on your goals. In short, focus on the process, not your progress.

Depending on the goal, it can actually effect your long-term progress. Let’s say for example, you have a goal where you want to look good for summer. You’re going to start going to the gym 4x a week, and eat healthier to get that sexy beach body. Once the summer comes and you’ve achieved your goal. You stop and all your progress diminishes. Therefore, certain goals actually compete with consistent, long-term progress. Habits prevent the ‘yo-yo’ effect. It doesn’t matter how quickly you move forward, the point of habits is that you only move forward. Whereas with goals, you’re constantly making progress, falling back, making progress, falling back. It’s a viscous cycle that can be prevented by setting a goal and then picking specific habits that are needed to move you toward your goal.

You’d work for 3 15-minute chunks back-to-back followed by a 15-minute break. Breaks give your mind a chance to recover. It’s the recovery that is crucial for working long hours everyday and still being productive.

But I have some great news, many of the abilities people feel they’re lacking such as willpower is just like a muscle. And, like any muscle, its small and weak when it’s not used. And, becomes big and strong when it’s used frequently. Willpower can be improved overtime to become stronger. It can be depleted and restored.

Certain things you need to do will cause anxiety, it’s only natural. The reason you have a habit to procrastinate is because when you feel anxious toward doing something. When you escape, lets say you browse the internet to suppress the anxious feelings. This is considered a reward to your brain. Every time you feel anxious, its habitual for you to find a means of escape to suppress the negative emotions.

This is a cycle of anxiety-to-avoidance. The anxiety only gets worse because the longer you avoid that thing, the more your work load piles up. This is why setting even stricter deadlines, thinking you’ll make up for lost time, never works. You’re only putting more pressure on yourself, and you’re only going to want to escape the negative feelings even more.

The best way to manage the feeling of overwhelm is to write down everything you have to do in small-manageable steps and prioritize them. The 3x15 method is fantastic for dealing with feelings of overwhelm. Procrastinating a certain task can be easily solved by only telling yourself that you’ll work on something for a few minutes.

It’s important to understand what the worst thing that can possibly happen is, and it’s very likely its nothing bad at all. As long as your life or someone else's life isn’t dependent upon a single decision you make. There’s really nothing to be afraid of because every mistake you make will just be a learning experience. I understand its easier said than done to rationalize yourself out of procrastination. Just write down all the ways that you can fail and decide that you acknowledge what it is and you’re going to continue working towards your goal despite the perceived obstacle in front of you. Successful people are focused on getting things done, not on the illusion of perfection.

Stop comparing yourself to others. You don't know how much time and effort someone has put into something to get to where they are. By comparing yourself to someone who’s further along than you all you. All you’re doing is hurting your self-esteem and you might even verbally beat yourself up. The truth is there’s nothing special between you and the people that are successful.
